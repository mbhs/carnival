            The Carnival of the Animals is a community music festival hosted by Montgomery Blair High School.
            Our goal is to provide a fun and educational musical experience for young children.
        </p>
        <p class="" data-aos="fade-up">
            The festival's main event will be a performance of <i>Carnival of the Animals</i>, by Camille Saint-Saëns.
            We will also feature an "Instrument Petting Zoo," a marching band, instrument making, face painting,
            raffle prizes, and more.

            Member of Blair Bands and Orchestras will be on hand with their instruments
            so kids can see them, learn a bit about them and can try them out. We expect
            to have a full compliment of band and orchestra instruments,
            as well as pianos on hand.  This is something the National Symphony Orchestra
            does, but it costs way more and is all the way downtown!
